After satellite is built
- turn off DHCP in private network
- build example.com network
- destroy_vm_on_host_delete yes
- root_pass ?
- what's up with model? butting libvirt hypervisor there (need to fix but low prio)

More satellite config
- configure pxe boot
- configure dns resource
- fixup PS1

+ hypervisor configuration:
- generate ssh keypair for foreman user on satellite
- copy public key to hypervisor
- libvirt-client needs to be install
- get host key verified? actually need to fixup known_hosts file
- public key goes on hypervisor as authorized_key for root user
(how to hit multiple machines in playbook? )

+ Provisioning steps needed
- patch instance based provisioning
- configure compute resource
- add rhel 8 instance
- add host4.home ssh key to server.example.com
- add ansible roles

Demo @ UIUC (external auth and stateless boot)
- provision NFS server 50G
- satellite client 6 repo
- push my ssh key to clients (some kind of bug there... look into that later)
- set default_pxe_item_local to rhel8=over-NFS
- import custom provisioning template
- create custom nfs profile
Settings -> Provisioning -> “Local boot PXELinux template”
disable build mode
( 
  - default_pxe_item_local to rhel8-over-nfs3
)

Demo @ NOAA (openscap compliance test)
+- provision instance
- setup scap policies



in-place upgrade 
- convert-to-rhel 
- use leapp

other tasks for satellite workshop
- import and export content

--- 
- turn on connect by IP (DNS is a mess right now)
- subscription-manager config --rhsm.manage_repos=1 (WHY NOT IN REGISTRATION SCRIPT?)
- refresh manifest so that I can sync repos
- dnf install rhc-worker-playbook

Validate network:
- remote execution via ssh
- remote execution via mqtt
