alternatives



stateful installation (PXE to RHEL Anaconda installer with ~kickstart)
stateless (PXE to RAM image)
creation of RAM image
PXE support in general, including DHCP/TFTP, and ability to accept from different subnets
DNS services?
bootstrapping ad-ons, e.g., ability to serve NFS or for us to publish Ad-hoc content via HTTP and run “postscripts” to pull that down and act on it
simple bootstrapping – e.g. mount persistent disks to stateless image – are these done with simple Ansible playbooks (independent of Ansible Automation)
examples of using Ansible playbooks directly from Satellite (not Ansible Automation)
any control capabilities: IPMI, remote console, parallel shell — can these be orchestrated remotely/in a distributed fashion from Satellite? or is it possible to set those things up on capsules?
Host Log aggregation and host state monitoring – e.g. SEL or console logs from IPMI
Different external authentication based on Locations or Organizations (or just support for multiple external authentication in general)
